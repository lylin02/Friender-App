This app is called Friender. Its purpose is to help students who are struggling with loneliness find friends with similar interests and a similar mindset at their school, so they can have a more positive self-image and be happier. The central part of this app is the matching algorithm. When someone starts using the app, he or she is given a list of hobbies to choose from, and our algorithm matches the person with someone with similar hobbies. If both people agree on the match, then they are able to set a meeting time and place.
